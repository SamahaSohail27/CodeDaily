- Step 1:
  -
  - Add extra source vertex in the graph. Connect every Vertex with this new vertex with 0 weight. We are adding the virtual source vertex because if we use any other vertex as the source vertex then it might be possible that we do not reach any vertex through this source vertex.
- Step 2:
  - Apply Bellman-Ford's algo and update the weights
