  - i is alwasy greater than j for non zero elements.
  - For nxn matrix the number of non zero elements will be
    - 1+2+3+4+......+n=n(n+1)/2
  - For nxn matrix the number of zero elements will be
    - n^2 - n(n+1)/2 = n(n-1)/2
  - To store them in memory we do not ned to store zero elements .
    - If want to store them in row by row then use Row Major Method
      - Mapping 2d to 1D:
         - To go to any row  r we now there are r-1 rows before this row and number of elements in these rows will be r(r-1)/2
         - After that now check to which column you want to move for example if want to move to  column number 3 means 2 columns we have to skip so add this also
         - (c-1) + r(r-1)/2
