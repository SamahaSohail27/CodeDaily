# Task 1: 
Write a method printSquares that has an integer parameter n, and prints the squares of the integers from 1 to n, separated by commas. It should print the squares of the odd integers in descending order first and then following with the squares of the even integers in ascending order. It does not print a newline character.
For example, printSquares(4) should print 9, 1, 4, 16 printSquares(1) should print 1 printSquares(7) should print 49, 25, 9, 1, 4, 16, 36
You may NOT use helper methods to solve this problem; write a single method.
