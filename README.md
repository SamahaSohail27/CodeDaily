- Step 1:
  -
  - Add extra source vertex in graph . Connect every Vertex with this new vertex with 0 weight. We re adding the source vertex to eliminate any negative weight
- Step 2:
  - Apply Bellman Ford to eliminate neagtive values and convert into positive weight edges. We can also say re weighting negative edges
