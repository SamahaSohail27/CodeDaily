# Kruskal's Algorithm
- To find minimum spanning tree. Minimum means having minim weights and spanning tree means all the nodes should be connected.
- Consider all nodes to be independant.
- Then arrange them in lowest to heighest weight
- Pop the lowest weight one . If by adding it in graph loop become then do not add it
